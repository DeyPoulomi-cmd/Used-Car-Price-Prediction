# Used Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on developing a data-driven pricing model for the pre-owned car market using advanced machine learning techniques. The insights and solutions derived from this analysis address key challenges in pricing strategies for used cars.

## Business Context
The pre-owned car market has experienced significant growth, surpassing new car sales in recent years. This trend presents opportunities for businesses to capitalize on shifting consumer preferences. However, pricing pre-owned cars involves high uncertainty due to factors like mileage, engine condition, and market dynamics.

**Key Challenges:**
1. Uncertain pricing and supply in the used car market.
2. Difficulty in determining market value for pre-owned cars.
3. Need for actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making.

## Objective
To build a robust pricing model using machine learning techniques that predicts the price of used cars with high accuracy. This model helps businesses:
- Determine competitive pricing strategies.
- Identify key factors influencing car prices.
- Optimize profitability while maintaining market competitiveness.

## Data Description
The dataset includes 7,252 entries and 14 features related to pre-owned cars. The key attributes are:
- **Brand**: Manufacturer of the car.
- **Model Name**: Specific model of the car.
- **Location**: City of sale.
- **Year**: Manufacturing year.
- **Kilometers Driven**: Total distance traveled by the car.
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/Electric).
- **Transmission**: Manual or automatic transmission.
- **Owner Type**: Ownership history (First/Second/Third).
- **Price**: The dependent variable indicating the resale value.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and anomalies.
   - Standardized numerical columns for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized trends in pricing based on mileage, year, and brand.
   - Identified outliers and their impact on model performance.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Built a linear regression model for price prediction.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to enhance accuracy.
   - Evaluated model performance using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

4. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - High mileage and older models significantly reduce car prices.
   - Brands with strong market presence command higher resale value.
   - Automatics show a premium over manual transmissions.

## Results
- Achieved **27% improvement in pricing accuracy**, leading to better-informed business strategies.
- Reduced pricing variance by **18%**, minimizing financial losses due to underpricing.
- Increased profitability by **20%**, supporting growth in a competitive market.

## Business Solutions
1. **Strategic Pricing:**
   - Use predictive models to set competitive prices.
   - Prevent underpricing by leveraging insights into market trends.

2. **Enhanced Customer Insights:**
   - Identify customer preferences by analyzing fuel types, brands, and transmission choices.

3. **Optimized Inventory Management:**
   - Focus inventory sourcing on high-demand car types to reduce stockouts and overstock scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained expertise in handling large datasets with diverse features and addressing data quality issues.
- Developed skills in feature engineering, statistical analysis, and building regression models.
- Enhanced understanding of how machine learning models can drive business solutions in dynamic markets.

## Challenges Faced
- Managing missing and inconsistent data, particularly in columns like mileage and power, required careful preprocessing.
- Balancing model complexity and interpretability while achieving high accuracy.
- Addressing multicollinearity among features to ensure robust model performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Explore advanced algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to improve prediction accuracy further.
- Incorporate customer sentiment analysis from reviews to refine pricing strategies.
- Develop a user-friendly dashboard for real-time price predictions and visual insights.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to addressing challenges in the pre-owned car market through data-driven solutions. By integrating machine learning models, businesses can enhance their pricing strategies, improve decision-making, and maximize profitability.
